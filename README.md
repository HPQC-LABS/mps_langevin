# mps_langevin (Matrix Product State Langevin)

Implementation of matrix product state Langevin equation in MATLAB. 

This repository contains code for manipulation of matrix product states for finite and infinite spin chains.

The matrix product state Langevin equation describes trajectories of a system in thermal contact with its environment, through
noise and dissipation terms. Included in this repository are implementations of the time-dependent variational principle evolution algorithm after Jutho Haegeman et al (Haegeman et al, PRB 88, 075133 (2013)) for finite and infinite systems; and an implementation of the matrix product state Langevin equation for finite systems.
